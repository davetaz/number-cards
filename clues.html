    <h1>Clues for the Number Cards Exercise</h1>
    <p>Use these clues to guide your thinking as you analyse the dataset. These hints will help you narrow down possibilities and refine your hypotheses.</p>

    <h2>Important clues:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>The dataset is complete.</strong><br>
        There is no more data beyond what you see in the cards. It is not a sample, subset, or part of a larger dataset.
        <br><em>→ Your explanation should account for the specific and limited number of entries. Ask yourself: what kind of dataset could be fully represented by just these numbers?</em>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>The numbers are exact.</strong><br>
        There has been no rounding or estimation. The numbers are presented in their precise and original form.
        <br><em>→ This means you can trust the detail of the values — patterns in exact digits, decimal places, or specific values might offer useful insights.</em>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>The numbers are discrete and independent.</strong><br>
        Each number stands on its own — none are the result of calculations involving others (no sums, averages, percentages, or derived values).
        <br><em>→ Don’t look for arithmetic relationships or combinations. Focus instead on what each individual value might represent by itself.</em>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>These clues are designed to help you think critically and avoid common pitfalls. Stay focused on what you *can* say based on the data — and what you *can’t*.</p>
