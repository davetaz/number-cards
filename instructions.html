    <h1>Number Cards Exercise</h1>
    <p>This exercise is a challenge to work out what the numbers represent. You will follow three main steps: observe, analyse, and interpret.</p>

    <h2>How to interact with the number cards:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>You can <strong>click and drag</strong> each number card to move it around your screen — rearrange them in whatever way helps your thinking.</li>
      <li><strong>Click on a number</strong> to highlight it in red — this is useful for marking patterns, outliers, or groups.</li>
      <li>Use the on-screen buttons to:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Re-order</strong> the cards — sort them quickly, for example by value.</li>
          <li><strong>Re-scatter</strong> the cards — randomly shuffle their positions for a fresh view.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps in the exercise:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Make some observations</strong><br>
        Begin by looking at the numbers and recording facts. At this stage, focus only on what you can directly observe. Avoid jumping to conclusions or making assumptions. Instead, note down:
        <ul>
          <li>The format of the numbers (e.g. integers, decimals, large/small values)</li>
          <li>Any patterns you can see (e.g. repetition, order, range)</li>
          <li>Outliers or anything that stands out</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Do some analysis</strong><br>
        Now, move on to analysing the numbers. Use calculations or visualisations to uncover further insights:
        <ul>
          <li>Calculate totals, averages, differences, or other summary statistics</li>
          <li>Visualise the data – a simple chart or sketch may help reveal trends or distributions</li>
          <li>Group or sort the numbers – is there a natural categorisation?</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Interpret your analysis</strong><br>
        Finally, come up with a few hypotheses about what the numbers could represent. For each hypothesis, ask yourself:
        <ul>
          <li>Do my observations and analysis support this idea?</li>
          <li>Is there evidence that disproves it?</li>
          <li>What else would I need to know to be more confident?</li>
        </ul>
        Try to link your ideas back to the data and consider multiple possibilities.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>This exercise is about being curious, methodical, and open-minded in how you approach unfamiliar data.</p>
