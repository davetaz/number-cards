    <h2>Key statistics:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Count (n):</strong> 28 players</li>
      <li><strong>Sum:</strong> Approx. $16,000,000</li>
      <li><strong>Mean (average):</strong> $564,798</li>
      <li><strong>Median:</strong> $101,248 (approximately $100,000) – falls between $90,000 and $112,496</li>
      <li><strong>Mode:</strong> $44,000 – the second-lowest salary. While this doesn't correspond to a minimum wage, it still reflects common lower-tier pay.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Workbook tabs overview:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Raw Numbers:</strong>
        <br>Contains only the salary figures. Participants use this sheet to make initial observations and visual patterns.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Numbers + Categories:</strong>
        <br>Each salary is paired with a category label. These labels represent player positions:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>K</strong> = Goalkeeper</li>
          <li><strong>D</strong> = Defender</li>
          <li><strong>M</strong> = Midfielder</li>
          <li><strong>F</strong> = Forward</li>
        </ul>
        This allows learners to explore whether player position correlates with pay.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Summary Stats:</strong>
        <br>Provides key numerical summaries including min, max, range, median, mode, mean, and totals — useful for cross-checking learner calculations or discussing distribution shape.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Visuals:</strong>
        <br>Includes pre-prepared box plots and histograms to help learners interpret spread, outliers, and skew in the data.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Pedagogical notes:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Emphasise that learners should avoid assumptions early on — the clues (discrete, exact, complete dataset) are designed to encourage disciplined thinking.</li>
      <li>There are multiple plausible hypotheses, but only one correct interpretation. Encourage discussion around alternative ideas and how data supports or refutes them.</li>
      <li>Look out for misconceptions around the mode or assuming the dataset is incomplete or rounded.</li>
      <li>When the categories are revealed, prompt learners to explore possible biases, inequality, or structural patterns in pay by role.</li>
    </ul>
